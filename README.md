# Boradgame-AI New approach
Mammalath boardgame project that uses special heuristic algorithm like this ; Tree searching  is began from played piece moves  that is very innovative approach . let's start discussion and any question is appreciated .
Mammalath as shown in this link ;  https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=mammalath  , is a semi abstract Boardgame that 
is played in two player mode with a three in a row (three pieces of board in one color , white or black) in a special rule
position . In following , read the rule and see the game in action (java base video) from the link above .
We will solve and  build this project with completely new way and approach . 
First phase of program code must contain the algorithmes of pattern seeking (winning of them ).
Next phase will be the ability of using them in an situation (that differs in every game as of accidentally patterns of animals).
The program will update itself at every single session (playing of a every game play competition with an human or a bot !).
All results will store in a file with a method of special Data structure or any zipping algorithmes or another dynamic methods .
Speed of access and successful codes are preferred to use in proggress .
Any further explanations will be given if please ask them in Issues section or another above head manu .
